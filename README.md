# What is dora-rs?

Dataflow-oriented robotic application (dora-rs) is a framework that makes creation of robotic applications fast and simple.

Building a robotic application can be summed up as bringing together hardwares, algorithms, and AI models, and make them communicate with each others. At dora-rs, we try to:

- make integration of hardware and software easy by supporting Python, C, C++, and also ROS2.
- make communication low latency by using zero-copy Arrow messages.

dora-rs is still experimental and you might experience bugs, but we're working very hard to make it stable as possible.

## Performance

dora-rs can show impressive performance, up to 17x faster compared to current status quo ROS2 in Python! This is the result of using our own shared memory server and Apache Arrow to achieve zero copy data passing.

> See: https://github.com/dora-rs/dora-benchmark/tree/main for reproduction.

## Dataflow Paradigm

dora-rs implements a declarative dataflow paradigm where tasks are split between nodes isolated as individual processes.

Each node defines its inputs and outputs to connect with other nodes.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: webcam
    custom:
      source: webcam.py
      inputs:
        tick: dora/timer/millis/50
      outputs:
        - image

  - id: object_detection
    custom:
      source: object_detection.py
      inputs:
        image: webcam/image
      outputs:
        - bbox

  - id: plot
    custom:
      source: plot.py
      inputs:
        image: webcam/image
        bbox: object_detection/bbox
```

Nodes can either be:

- custom nodes were dora-rs is embedded as a native libraries.
- runtime nodes were dora-rs takes care of the main loop and run user-defined operators. This make dora-rs featureful as we can run features like `hot-reloading`.

The dataflow paradigm has the advantage of creating an abstraction layer that makes robotic applications modular and easily configurable.

## Communication

Communication between nodes is handled with shared memory on a same machine and TCP on distributed machines. Our shared memory implementation tracks messages across processes and discards them when obsolete. Shared memory slots are cached to avoid new memory allocation.

## Message Format

Nodes communicate with Apache Arrow Data Format.

[Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) is a universal memory format for flat and hierarchical data. The Arrow memory format supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead. It defines a C data interface without any build-time or link-time dependency requirement, that means that dora-rs has **no compilation step** beyond the native compiler of your favourite language.

## Opentelemetry

dora-rs uses Opentelemetry to record all your logs, metrics and traces. This means that the data and telemetry can be linked using a shared abstraction.

[Opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open source observability standard that makes dora-rs telemetry collectable by most backend such as elasticseach, prometheus, Datadog..

Opentelemetry is language independent, backend agnostic, and easily collect distributed data, making it perfect for dora-rs applications.

## Hot-Reloading

dora-rs implements Hot-Reloading for python which means you can change code at runtime in Python while keeping your state intact.

Using the feature flag: `--attach --hot-reload`, dora-rs watch for code change and reload nodes that has been modified.
You can check fail-safe mechanism at: https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/pull/239

## Self-Coding Robot: Code RAG (WIP)

You can easily create a self-coding robot, by combining Hot-reloading with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that is going to generate code modification from your prompt.
See:[examples/python-operator-dataflow](examples/python-operator-dataflow)

<img src="https://github.com/dora-rs/dora-rs.github.io/blob/main/static/img/RAG.svg?raw=true" align="center" width="600">

Self-Coding Robot is just the tip of the iceberg of robotics combined with llm, that we hope to power. There is so much more that we haven't explored yet like:

- [self-debugging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05128.pdf)
- [memory](https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT)
- [function calling](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla)
- ...

## Installation

Quickest way:

```bash
cargo install dora-cli --locked
pip install dora-rs # For Python API

dora --help
```

For more info on installation, check out [our guide](https://www.dora-rs.ai/docs/guides/Installation/installing).

## Getting Started

1. Install the example python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/requirements.txt
```

2. Get some example operators:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/webcam.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/plot.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/utils.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/object_detection.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora-rs/dora/v0.3.5/examples/python-operator-dataflow/dataflow.yml
```

3. Start the dataflow

```bash
dora up
dora start dataflow.yml --attach --hot-reload
```

> Make sure to have a webcam

To stop your dataflow, you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>

To go further, you can add a yolov8 operator, check out our getting started here: https://www.dora-rs.ai/docs/guides/getting-started/yolov8/

## ROS2 Bridge

- Compilation Free Message passing to ROS 2
- Automatic conversion ROS 2 Message <-> Arrow Array

```python
import random
import pyarrow as pa

# Configuration Boilerplate...
turtle_twist_writer = ...

## Arrow Based ROS2 Twist Message
## which does not requires ROS2 import
message = pa.array([{
            "linear": {
                "x": 1,
            },
            "angular": {
                "z": 1
            },
        }])

turtle_twist_writer.publish(message)
```

### Unstable functionality

`dora-rs` Ros2 Bridge is marked as **unstable**.
There are a number of reasons functionality may be marked as unstable:

- We are unsure about the exact API. The name, function signature, or implementation are likely to change in the future.
- The functionality is not tested extensively yet. Bugs may pop up when used in real-world scenarios.
- The functionality does not integrate well with the full dora-rs API. You may find it works in one context but not in another.

Releasing functionality as unstable allows us to gather important feedback from users that use dora-rs in real-world scenarios.
This helps us fine-tune things before giving it the final stamp of approval.
Users are only interested in solid, well-tested functionality can avoid this part of the API.

Functionality marked as unstable may change at any point without it being considered a breaking change.
