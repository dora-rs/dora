    Point Structure of Pointcept

    A Point (point cloud) in Pointcept is a dictionary that contains various properties of
    a batched point cloud. The property with the following names have a specific definition
    as follows:

    - "coord": original coordinate of point cloud;
    - "grid_coord": grid coordinate for specific grid size (related to GridSampling);
    Point also support the following optional attributes:
    - "offset": if not exist, initialized as batch size is 1;
    - "batch": if not exist, initialized as batch size is 1;
    - "feat": feature of point cloud, default input of model;
    - "grid_size": Grid size of point cloud (related to GridSampling);
    (related to Serialization)
    - "serialized_depth": depth of serialization, 2 ** depth * grid_size describe the maximum of point cloud range;
    - "serialized_code": a list of serialization codes;
    - "serialized_order": a list of serialization order determined by code;
    - "serialized_inverse": a list of inverse mapping determined by code;
    (related to Sparsify: SpConv)
    - "sparse_shape": Sparse shape for Sparse Conv Tensor;
    - "sparse_conv_feat": SparseConvTensor init with information provide by Point;
