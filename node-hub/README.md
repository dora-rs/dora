# Dora Node Hub

This hub contains useful pre-built nodes for Dora.




# Python

## Add a new python node

- To work on a new node, start by:

```bash
cd node-hub
dora new your-node-name --lang python --kind node
cd ./your-node-name
uv venv --seed -p 3.11
uv pip install -e . # Install
uv run ruff check . --fix # Format
uv run ruff check . # Lint
uv run pytest . # Test
```

- To add a python dependency just do:

```bash
uv add numpy # for example
```

> The package is then added to your `pyproject.toml`

- Modify the code within `main.py` in your liking.

- Create a PR and let the CI/CD run test on it ðŸ™‹

## Structure

The structure of the node hub is as follows (please use the same structure if you need to add a new node):

```
node-hub/
â””â”€â”€ your-node/
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ your-node
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __main__.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
    â””â”€â”€ tests
        â””â”€â”€ test_<your-node>.py
```

The idea is to make a `pyproject.toml` file that will install the required dependencies for the node **and** attach main
function of the node inside a callable script in your environment.

To do so, you will need to add a `main` function inside the `main.py` file.

```python
def main():
    pass
```

And then you will need to adapt the following `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
name = "[name of the node e.g. video-encoder, with '-' to replace spaces]"
version = "0.1"
authors = [{ name = "[Pseudo/Name]", email = "[email]" }]
description = "Dora Node for []"
readme = "README.md"
license = { text = "MIT" }

dependencies = [
    "dora-rs >= 0.3.8",
]

[project.scripts]
[name of the node with '-' to replace spaces] = "[name of the node with '_' to replace spaces].main:main"

[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [
  "D",    # pydocstyle
  "UP",   # Ruff's UP rule
  "PERF", # Ruff's PERF rule
  "RET",  # Ruff's RET rule
  "RSE",  # Ruff's RSE rule
  "NPY",  # Ruff's NPY rule
  "N",    # Ruff's N rule
  "I",    # Ruff's I rule
]
```

Finally, the README.md file should explicit all inputs/outputs of the node and how to configure it in the YAML file.

## Example

```toml
[project]
name = "opencv-plot"
version = "0.1"
authors = [
    "Haixuan Xavier Tao <tao.xavier@outlook.com>",
    "Enzo Le Van <dev@enzo-le-van.fr>"
]
description = "Dora Node for plotting data with OpenCV"
readme = "README.md"
license = { text = "MIT" }
requires-python = ">=3.7"

dependencies = [
    "dora-rs >= 0.3.8",
]
[dependency-groups]
dev = ["pytest >=8.1.1", "ruff >=0.9.1"]

[project.scripts]
opencv-plot = "opencv_plot.main:main"

[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [
  "D",    # pydocstyle
  "UP",   # Ruff's UP rule
  "PERF", # Ruff's PERF rule
  "RET",  # Ruff's RET rule
  "RSE",  # Ruff's RSE rule
  "NPY",  # Ruff's NPY rule
  "N",    # Ruff's N rule
  "I",    # Ruff's I rule
]
```
## Adding git dependency
- If a git repository is added as submodule. Proper path should be added in `pyproject.toml` inorder to make sure that linting and testing are exempted for that dependency.
- A very good example of how this can be done is as follows

Correct approach:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
exclude = ["dora_magma/Magma"]

[tool.black]
extend.exclude = "dora_magma/Magma"
```
Incorrect Approach:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
exclude = ["dora-magma/dora_magma/Magma"]

[tool.black]
extend.exclude = "dora_magma/Magma"
```
##### Note:
- `dora-magma` is root folder of the node.

# Rust

## Add a new rust node

```bash
cd node-hub
dora new your-node-name --lang rust --kind node
cd ./your-node-name
```

## Steps Before Building

- Before building the node, make sure to add your node to the workspace members list in the root `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[workspace]
members = [
...
"node-hub/your-node-name"
]
```

- Also change the `Cargo.toml` file in your node to use the workspace version of dora-node-api:

```
[dependencies]
dora-node-api = { workspace = true }
```

## Structure

The structure of the node hub for Rust is as follows (please use the same structure if you need to add a new node):

```
node-hub/
â””â”€â”€ your-node/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ src/
           â””â”€â”€ main.rs
```

The README.md file should explicit all inputs/outputs of the node and how to configure it in the YAML file.

# Node Testing

The `run-node` command allows you to test individual dora nodes without creating a full dataflow.

## Usage

```bash
dora run-node [OPTIONS] <NODE_PATH>
```

### Arguments

- `<NODE_PATH>` - Path to the node file to run

### Options

- `--input <INPUT_FILE>` - Path to input data file (YAML)
- `--uv` - Use UV to run nodes
- `-h, --help` - Print help

## Examples

### Run a node without inputs

```bash
dora run-node path/to/your/node.py
```

### Run a node with custom inputs

```bash
dora run-node path/to/your/node.py --input inputs.yml
```

### Run a node with UV

```bash
dora run-node path/to/your/node.py --uv
```

## Input File Formats

The `run-node` command supports two input file formats:

### 1. Standard Dora Dataflow Schema (Recommended)

Use the same format as regular Dora dataflow files:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: test-node
    inputs:
      test_message: "Hello, Dora!"
      image_data: 
        width: 640
        height: 480
        format: "rgb8"
    outputs:
      - processed_image
    env:
      DEBUG: "true"
```

### 2. Simple Array Format (Backward Compatible)

A simpler format for basic testing:

```yaml
- type: INPUT
  id: input_id
  value: "Input value"
  metadata: {}
```

## Node Development

When developing nodes, you can check for the `DORA_TEST_MODE` environment variable to determine if the node is being run in test mode:

```python
import os

if os.environ.get("DORA_TEST_MODE") == "true":
    # Node is running in test mode
    # You can modify behavior for testing
    pass
```

Inputs provided through the `--input` option are available in the `DORA_TEST_INPUTS` environment variable as a YAML string.
