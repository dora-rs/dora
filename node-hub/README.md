## Dora Node Hub

This hub contains useful pre-built nodes for Dora.

# Structure

The structure of the node hub is as follows (please use the same structure if you need to add a new node):

```
node-hub/
└── your-node/
    ├── main.py
    ├── README.mdr
    └── pyproject.toml
```

The idea is to make a `pyproject.toml` file that will install the required dependencies for the node **and** attach main
function of the node inside a callable script in your environment.

To do so, you will need to add a `main` function inside the `main.py` file.

```python
def main():
    pass
```

And then you will need to adapt the following `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "[name of the node e.g. video-encoder, with '-' to replace spaces]"
version = "0.1"
authors = ["[Pseudo/Name] <[email]>"]
description = "Dora Node for []"
readme = "README.md"

packages = [
    { include = "main.py", to = "[name of the node with '_' to replace spaces]" }
]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
dora-rs = "0.3.5"
... [add your dependencies here] ...

[tool.poetry.scripts]
[name of the node with '-' to replace spaces] = "[name of the node with '_' to replace spaces].main:main"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

Finally, the README.md file should explicit all inputs/outputs of the node and how to configure it in the YAML file.

# Example

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "opencv-plot"
version = "0.1"
authors = [
    "Haixuan Xavier Tao <tao.xavier@outlook.com>",
    "Enzo Le Van <dev@enzo-le-van.fr>"
]
description = "Dora Node for plotting data with OpenCV"
readme = "README.md"

packages = [
    { include = "main.py", to = "opencv_plot" }
]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
dora-rs = "^0.3.5"
opencv-python = "^4.10.0.84"

[tool.poetry.scripts]
opencv-plot = "opencv_plot.main:main"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```
