# Input and expected Outputs for Tests

- The input files were generated using the `DORA_WRITE_EVENTS_TO` environment variable.
  - See
    the "Generating Input Files" section in the
    [apis/rust/node/src/integration_testing.rs](../../apis/rust/node/src/integration_testing.rs)
    file.
- The output files were generated by starting the nodes in integration test mode.
  - Set the `DORA_TEST_WITH_INPUTS` env variable to the path of the input file and start the node
    executable directly
  - To avoid time offsets in the output, set `DORA_TEST_NO_OUTPUT_TIME_OFFSET=1`
  - For more details see the
    [apis/rust/node/src/integration_testing.rs](../../apis/rust/node/src/integration_testing.rs)
    file.
