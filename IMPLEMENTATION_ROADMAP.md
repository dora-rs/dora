## üõ†Ô∏è AI-Assisted Development Notes

### Recommended AI Development Approach:
1. **Start with Critical Path**: Focus on #1, #2, #3, #9 first
2. **Implement in Dependency Order**: Never start an issue without its dependencies
3. **Use Comprehensive Testing**: Each issue has detailed acceptance criteria
4. **Reference Implementation Files**: Each issue links to detailed `.md` files
5. **Follow CLI Manual**: Use `DORA_CLI_MANUAL.md` for consistency

### AI Development Tips:
- **Read Issue Files**: Each `issues/###-*.md` file contains complete implementation details
- **Follow Rust Patterns**: Use async/await, proper error handling, performance optimization
- **Test Thoroughly**: Each issue includes comprehensive testing requirements
- **Maintain Performance**: Target 60 FPS for TUI, <200ms for transitions
- **Document Progress**: Update issue status and acceptance criteria

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests validate workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Manual testing confirms user experience
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
